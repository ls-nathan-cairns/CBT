# CBT (Code Brocard Transformation)

This project aims to transform a *control flow graph* (CFG), to valid and equivalent python code using machine learning methods. The CFG may be abstracted to some extent.

This repository contains scripts for preparing training data as well as training machine learning models.

## Setup
1. Clone the repo and make sure you have ``python 3.0^`` installed!
2. Download the dataset [here](https://eth-sri.github.io/py150) under **Download Source Files** described as *An archive of source files used to generate the py150 Dataset*. 
3. Unzip *all* the contents of the downloaded file, and copy the directory ``py150_files`` from the unzipped contents to the ``data`` directory in your cloned repository. The contents of your data directory should look something like:
```
CBT
└── data
    ├── py150_files
    |   ├── data
    |   |   └──...
    |   ├── github_repos.txt
    |   ├── python50k_eval.txt
    |   ├── python100k_train.txt
    |   └── README.md
    └── .gitkeep

```
4. Run ``python setup.py install``
5. ...
